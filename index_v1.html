      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML <em>hyper text markup language</em> is a computer language used to create web pages on the Internet.  The Internet uses HTTP to transmit data to and from servers.  HTML is the heart of the web and includes documents is made up of text content (what you see), markup (what content looks like), references to images and videos, other documents and links to other pages.</p><p>HTML is made up of elements.  An element consists of &lt;opening tags&gt; content and &lt;closing tags&gt;. Remember, computers are not stupid they are sensitive.  Computers do exactly as the computer programmers tell them.</p>

        <h2 class="concept-title">HTML Attributes</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML Attributes are within a tag and a tag may have multiple attributes &lt;tag attr="value"&gt;contents&lt;/tag&gt;.  The attribute &lt;a&gt; is an anchor tag. Anchors are for making links. href is an attribute that indictates the URL being linked. Example &lt;a href=”www.reddit.com”&gt; derp&lt;/a&gt; creates <a href=”www.reddit.com”> derp</a> on the web page.  Selecting the link sends the user to the url www.reddit.com.</p><p>Another attribute is &lt;img&gt; which is used for including images, example: &lt;img svc=”url” alt=”text”&gt;.  The alt=”text” piece is required for broken requests.  The alt attribute is also there for those who are blind.  Example: <img src=http://www.udacity.com/cs2e53x/hipmunk.pgn alt="hipmonk!">.  The img attribute does not require a closing tag because it has no content.</p>

      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Whitespace</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>There are Inline and Block elements.   br = break in the line is an Inline element, p = paragraph which is used around the text and is a Block element. Text can be on one or multiple lines and is dependent on which type of tag is used.</p><b>Inline:</b> &lt;br&gt;, &lt;em&gt; <em>(italic)</em>, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;<br><b>Block:</b> &lt;span&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;form&gt;<br><b>Container Elements:</b> store stuff inside them<br><p> &lt;Span&gt; represents an inline element.  Span is like words within a sentence. <span>All text remains in one line.</span> But when changed to div the content is now block.</p>
        </div>

      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>An HTML Document has a basic structure with a head which includes the meta-data, java script, css and title.  The body of the document contains all the data and images, what is considered the instersting stuff, the contents of the docuemnt. These two sections are found within the  opening and closing html tags.</p> <img src="html-structure.jpg" alt="html structure"><p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;  designates what kind of HTML is used and is listed before the opening html.</p>
        </div>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Create a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">HTML, CSS and Java</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML is the structure; syntax, rules of the page.  CSS is the style, how it looks. Java is the interactive components.  HTML controls the structure of a page using DOM, a tree like structure.  Hteml filesa are like the structure of a house.  When looking at the structure you are determining where the walls go, what size are the rooms, where does the kitchen go?  CSS is the style of the document, how things look. In the house example this would be the pictures on the wall, colors of the floor and walls.  Java script files are interactive components like a garage door opener and tv remote.  These change some element of your house.</p><p>There are rules for how a website behaves and many web tools to help you build websites. For example Wikipedia's inner structure can be viewed using Google Chrome. DevTools shows the structure of the page as the browser interprets it. Every element in a structure is a rectangle.  If you go deep enought into a structure you will find the same data that is on the web page. the sideways triangle is an html element that could be text or another element. Web pages include images and text.</p><p>The style panel is on the right. When a line on the left side is selected the CSS style is presented on the right. The web browser knows how to display the the HTML file, data, and images by following the syntax and rules of the DOM</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">DOM</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>“DOM” (document object model) is the tree-like structure of a web page, a branching structure.  DOM is a standard convention for representing or interacting with objects in HTML. HTML is made up of tags in elements which make up the tree.  These elements are nested creating the branches. This is how HTML classifies page contents, tells the browser which part is text or image.</p><p>To tie structure and style together the HTML document can provide the browser with info on what style to use and where to get it.  There are specific rules for how these elements work. To define style use the CSS <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em> language.  CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules to change how the text looks on the web, the borders, position, font etc.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Boxes, Boxes Everywhere</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>In the shapes demo, right click on a web page>inspect element to view the HTML and CSS.  Everything is in rectangles.  If you uncheck the border radius circles become a square.</p><p>“Boxify” your design. Start with big boxes.  Don’t worry about the text or images initially, work from big to small.  From the boxes create HTML.  Example used was My Favorite Apps, with an image and text.  Class attributes are labels on boxes that remind you of what is inside. These can have several labels.  Use descriptive labels to help remind you of what the box is for.  For instance the top box could be “title”.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Style</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>The structure created by My App (example in class) does not include style.  Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, then add &lt;html&gt; to indicate we are using html.  Add &lt;head&gt; to add style &lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=”style.css”&gt; then close tag for the &lt;/head&gt;.  The &lt;body&gt; tags include the code right before the end of lesson 2 for My App.  Now add style to the style.css file.  “.description {color:red;}”. Save the file and refresh browser.  You will see that the text in the description box turned red.</p><p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading means the most specific rule is applied to control the style ofHTML documents.  The rule that best describes the element is used.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Avoid Repetition</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Avoiding Repetition is important to maintain consistency throughout the HTML file.  The style can more easily be maintained and fewer errors are made.  Repetition can also make editing difficult. 
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Inheritance</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Inheritance is where the key feature in CSS properties are applied to an element and all its descendants.  Text related properties such as color, font, letter/line spacing (and others) can be inherited, but not box related properties such as background, border, display, float & clear.  Inheritance prevents repetition, and allows developers to write less CSS.  Also enhances faster loading of web pages and clients save money on bandwidth.</p><p>Instead of memorizing all attributes and tags utilize the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference Tool</a> which lists styles of HTML elements. To reduce repetition a rule can be setup to apply to every h1 element for example, or to a class. CSS can also be included in the head of your HTML, this is good for small projects.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Separate CSS File</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>For larger projects link the HTML file to a separate CSS file.  HTML is the main.html file, CSS is the main.css file.  Add a &lt;head&gt; tag to the top of the HTML then add a &lt;link&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; element. Reminder: Link is a void tag: there is no closing tag needed.  Add the following attributes to &lt;link&gt;</p><p><b>ref</b> = <em>"stylesheet"</em><br><b>type</b>= <em>"text/css"</em><br><b>href</b>= <em>"main.css"</em><br></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">The Box Model</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has four components: margin, border, padding and content.  Summing up the last three; border, padding and content make up the element width. Margin is not included.  'box-size:border-box' css code creates the calculation of the border size or set size of the border.</p><p>It can be difficult to get the box sizes just right. There are two techniques to help with sizing issues:</p>1. Use a percentage instead of pixels for size.<br> 2. Set box sizing attribute to border-box for every element<br><p>Add browser specific prefixes before style definition.  The size of the boxes are set in pixels.  These can also be done in percentages.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Box Positioning</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Flex-box layout is an efficient way to layout space in a container or box. Because divs are block elements they take up the entire width of the page by default.  By adding the flex rule display CSS will override this behavior and let the divs appear next to each other.  In the My App example the image is up against the left border and text directly to the right due to flex-box.</p>      
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Code, Test, Refine</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>To begin get a structure of the design and visually 'boxify' the page.  Create tags and headings, size the boxes, and position everything on the screen. Once a general layout is complete then begin working on the smaller details.</p><p>Divide and conquer, look for natural boxes.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements then begin writing your HTML.  Apply styles, again big to small, then go back and fix any problems.  Developer tools are extremely helpful, allowing the devloper to change things on the fly.  Make sure the mockup looks the same as the finished product. Look at the margin size and get as close to the mockup as possible.</p><p> Validation of code can be done using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">Markup Validation Service</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">CSS Validation Service</a>. These services will check the code for errors and provide warnings.
